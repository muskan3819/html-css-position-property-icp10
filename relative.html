    Scammers use social engineering techniques to trick people into giving away their personal and financial information. Their goal is to separate victims from their money, data, or physical objects. Here are some common scammer tactics: 
   <br><br>
    
    <b> Impersonation</b><br>
    <br>
    
    Scammers pretend to be someone you trust, like a company or government agency. They might say you'll be arrested, fined, or deported if you don't pay taxes or some other debt right away. 
  <br> 
  <br>
  <b> Sense of urgency</b><br><br>
    Scammers create a sense of urgency, intimidation, and fear to get you to act before you have a chance to check out their claims. 
    <br>
    <br> <b>Payment demands</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Scammers often demand payment through wire transfers, cryptocurrency, or gift cards.<br> 
    <br>

  <b>  Phishing emails and text messages</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Scammers send emails or text messages that look like they're from a company you know or trust. They might tell a story to trick you into clicking on a link or opening an attachment. 
    <br>
    <br>
<b> Card skimming</b>
    <br>
    <br>

    Scammers skim your card by putting a discreet attachment on an ATM or EFTPOS machine. They may even install a camera to capture your pin.
